![Serverless Microservices: Microservices without Containers](https://chadgreen.blob.core.windows.net/slides/ServerlessMicroservicesWithoutContainers.jpg)

## Abstract
Microservices have been the buzz for the past couple of years, and some excellent reasons. Just about anything you read shows implementing microservices using containers.  While containers are great, they bring in their challenges and are not always the right way to do microservices.  Another great way to implement microservices is through serverless technologies.  Think of the possibilities when you add all the benefits of serverless technology into a microservice architecture.

## Elevator Pitch
Microservices do not have to mean containers; in this session, you will learn how to use serverless technologies to implement a complete microservice architecture.

## Learning Objectives
-	Understand the concepts and benefits of microservice architectures
-	Understand what exactly serverless technologies are and their benefits
- See firsthand how-to user serverless technologies to implement a microservice architecture

## Type
